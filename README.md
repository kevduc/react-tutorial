# React Tutorial - Counters

👨‍🏫 Counters using React, created as part of an exercise in [Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/)'s Tutorial video: [React JS - React Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0).  

👨‍💻 The `App` consists of a `Counters` component that shows multiple `Counter` components that can be reset to zero and individually deleted, and a `NavBar` component at the top of the page that keeps track of the number of non-zero counters.
